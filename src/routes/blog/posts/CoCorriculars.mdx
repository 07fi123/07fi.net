## SIGCHI

### Description 
Look at us here trying desperately trying to complete the stats for the CHI 2025 paper. I think this was the first or second time we had to re-do them, cant remember it was a long night. Notice the pizza boxes, and general look of pain on everyone's face. In the end we ended up cranking out a great paper and hopefully it's good enough to take us to japan! 

### Reflection

When I came to Abilene Christian I had no remote desire to do anything but pass my classes. Coming from a background of academic strife taught me that school required my attention, I couldn't just wing it. I knew I had to be intentional about where I spent my time, however my desire for community was not expressly quiet. When invited by a classmate to this strange club with a funny name, I went, what the heck, how complex could SIGCHI really be? Now two years later we’ve been to Hawaii, we’ve presented research at CHI 2024 and are poised to be :fingers crossed emoji: accepted presenters at CHI 2025. I never thought I’d have my name on an honest to goodness research paper. Look at me now 2023 me! I almost have two!

### Description 

Whoa, it's the whole gang in Hawaii! This picture was taken the day before the CHI 2024 conference started We all had to do some paperwork and pick up some stuff at the conference venue, so after the business stuff we went upstairs to kind of look around. I think we really just didn't know what we wanted to do next so we took a selfie.

### Reflection

Now that I mention it, CHI 2024 was a whole experience in itself. It was awesome to get immersed in some cool panels, eat some nice snacks, and meet researchers from around the world! Did I mention the conference was in Hawaii!! All of the members that went had so much fun on the Island. We hiked, we ate, we swam with sea turtles! Overall an awesome experience that I soon won’t forget. Hopefully I get to update this entry with all the fun pictures we took at CHI 2025 (again :fingers crossed emoji:).
