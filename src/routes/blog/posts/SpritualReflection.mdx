When I left Nebraska to come to ACU I wasn't quite sure what I'd find. So before I left a friend of mine and I decided that we would keep in contact and the primary way we would keep in contact would be to pray with one another every week. So my brother in Christ Nathan and I prayed every single week up until the fall of 2023. Because the fall of 2023 was such an important semester We upped the ante and began to pray every single day. This increased my spiritual growth immensely in this area. In addition to prayer I've also cultivated other spiritual disciplines such as scripture. 

All ACU students are required to take an Old testament and a New testament course I was fortunate to be able to take the accelerated New testament course as part of my transfer so it was a fun but quick overview of the New testament this allowed me to see Jesus and his ministry in new lights and new ways I'm grateful for that. However I find that my time in the Old testament was really beneficial to me. I learned so much about Christian living by reading these books. Again the fall of 2025 was a pivotal year in my time here it separated the it will be okay from who knows it will if it will be okay and part of the reason I got through it part of the reason I got through algorithms the class is because I was almost daily in the Bible reading about the struggle and strife that the Israelites faced when they were in the wilderness. Because I also felt I was in the wilderness of life I related to that and it also strengthened me reminded me that God would make a way even when I felt there was no way All I had to do was trust him that this would happen you would make a way I did I made a huge way past my classes that semester. 

One of the awesome things about ACU that I really love is the chapels. I know a lot of people get upset that they have to do chapel credits and suffice it to say since I'm older and more wise and technically “spiritually formed” I don't have to do this requirement. However I do find myself enjoying it a lot specifically the hymns and immerse chapels both of these chapels are full on little worship times in the middle of my week I love that although Bible study and prayer and meditation and instruction are important parts of Christian living I've always connected on a visceral emotional level to worship it's something that comes really natural to me so having Tuesdays and Thursdays set aside for 30 minutes a time of worship and Thanksgiving fills up my spiritual gas tank and allows me to continue on side note I really hope that the immerse chapel figures out what they're going to do this semester I be really sad if my last semester didn't include it. 

The thing I'm going to miss the most about ACU though it's the people, what a wonderful group of human beings that God has gathered here to be together with him and with each other. The community here at the University is something you can't replace probably can't even replicate anywhere else. I know that I will miss it dearly it's one of the most wonderful things about this university that most people take for granted you can just strike up a conversation with just about anyone and it's rarely weird or strange to say hey how are you doing or Jesus loves you as you walk by I really pray and hope that those are still enjoying this experience Take that to heart and treasure it for what it is. 

My spiritual journey here at ACU is almost over I'm glad that I came here and was able to grow I don't know only an academics but spiritually as well God bless this place and may he continue to bless it I know that I'm better for it and my faith is stronger because of the people the prayers the songs and the scripture readings that we all did together I can't wait to take what I've learned out into the world.
