Throughout my time at ACU, I have learned a lot about myself and have grown in my spiritual life. Throughout this time at the University I've made a lot of strides in these growth factors namely in the areas of prayer, community worship, and scripture. All of these areas I continue to cultivate and will continue even after my time here. Let's just go over a few of them and discuss what I've learned.

When I left Nebraska to come to ACU I wasn't quite sure what I'd find. So before I left a friend of mine and I decided that we would keep in contact and the way we decided to do so was to pray with one another every week. So he and I prayed every single week up until the fall of 2023. Because the fall of 2023 was such an important semester We upped the ante and began to pray every single day. This increased my spiritual growth immensely in this area. In addition to prayer, I've also cultivated other spiritual disciplines such as scripture. 

All ACU students are required to take an Old Testament and a New Testament course. I was fortunate to be able to take the accelerated New Testament course as part of my transfer student privileges.  It was a fun but quick overview of the New Testament that allowed me to see Jesus and his ministry in new ways, and I'm grateful for that. However, I find that my time in the Old Testament was more beneficial to me. I learned so much about Christian living by reading those ancient books. Again the fall of 2023 was a pivotal year in my time here and part of the reason I got through it was the almost daily Bible readings that were assigned as a part of that course. I could directly apply the struggle and strife that the Israelites faced when they were in the wilderness. I also felt I was in the wilderness of life. I related to that and reading these wilderness stories reminded me that God would make a way, even when I felt there was no way. All I had to do was trust Him that he would be faithful and he was I made it through.  

One of the awesome things about ACU that I love is the chapels. I know a lot of people get upset that they have to do chapel credits and suffice it to say that since I'm older and more wise and technically “spiritually formed” I don't have to do this requirement. However, I do find myself enjoying it a lot specifically the Hymns and Immerse chapels. Both of these chapels are full-on little worship times in the middle of my week, I love that! Although Bible study, prayer, meditation, and instruction are important parts of Christian living I've always connected on a visceral emotional level to worship it's something that comes naturally to me so having Tuesdays and Thursdays set aside for 30 minutes of Worship and Thanksgiving fills up my spiritual gas tank.

The thing I'm going to miss the most about ACU is the people. What a wonderful group of human beings that God has gathered here to be together with Him and with each other. The community here at the University is something you can't replace and probably can't even replicate anywhere else. I know that I will miss it dearly it's one of the most wonderful things about this university that most people take for granted. It’s just incredible how open most people are to a random conversation or a smile.  Coming from a large R1 university experience, where everyone appears to just be going through the motions in our community it’s rare for people to be disconnected from one another. I pray and hope that those who are still enjoying this experience take that to heart and treasure it for what it is. 

My spiritual journey here at ACU is almost over I'm glad that I came here and was able to grow not only in academics but spiritually as well.  God bless this place and may he continue to bless it. I know that I'm better for it and my faith is stronger because of the people, the prayers, the songs, and the scripture readings that we all did together. I can't wait to take what I've learned out into the world.
