## NEXT LAB

The reason I even know about Abilene Christian is because of Next Lab. One fateful morning in August of 2024 I rolled over and booted up Hacker News, as was my morning tradition, and was surprised to see a World Nuclear News article with the headline: “Texas University to build USAs first Molten Salt Reactor”. I already knew about this technology and I understood its potential as a sustainable clean energy source, something that the world desperately needed. Moreover I knew that I wanted to do something meaningful with my time and talents and the mission of NEXT Lab to provide for the world's most critical needs of energy, water and medical isotopes spoke to me on multiple levels. 

## Spring Break 2023 and 2024

I’ve been a space nut ever since I was a child. My father, who happened to work for an advertising agency specializing in aviation, sat on the board for the Strategic Air and Space Museum so whenever I got the chance we would tour the Museum. I was so interested in flight and spaceflight and my parents supported my passion. I’ve never stopped loving that stuff, so when SpaceX started launching rockets from South Texas I had to go check it out. The past two Spring Breaks I’ve traveled down to South Padre to check out the Starship rocket program. Last year, 2024, I was fortunate that my trip also coincided with Starship flight test 3. Seeing a rocket that large fly was an amazing experience. I honestly still can’t describe the awesome power of that vehicle. To complete my experience I also found a heat tile from the Starship upper stage on the beach! I hope I can catch one more launch this year before I leave. If you haven’t had a chance yet to go to Padre, and watch a launch you won’t regret it’s an amazing experience.
