## Text Adventure: A stranger Among us
<img src={strangers2} style="width: 500px"/>

Although this assignment was not the most complex peice of software I’ve written it’s for sure one of my favorites. Reeves had us build a text adventure game for Software engineering one, at the time I thought it was a simple enough task but there was a catch I was not alone, I had two others on the team. Brendan, Alex, and myself had a blast building this little adventure. Some rooms, items, and a little text narrative, all the ingredients for a great adventure! Importantly we learned what it meant to ship software, how to define unknowns and user stories. All skills I’ve experienced in industry already, but it was cool to watch my teammates come to grips with shipping “real code”.   

## Disk Wars:

The Grid, a Digital Frontier. The year was 2010. The world was simpler and I was much younger. This was the year I bought my first computer and this is the year as a wide eyed 13 year old I saw Tron Legacy. Tron Legacy, the sequel to the 1982 movie Tron depicted a world inside a computer where the programs were people and code constructed “physical” things like light cycles. When the main character Sam Flynn enters the “Grid” he is forced into a gladiatorial combat game “Disk Wars”. For my Web Application Development class I implemented a version of “Disk Wars” in the browser. Using real time events using websockets multiple players at a time can battle one another by throwing disks. Give it a try with a friend with the link below. 

### Discrete Math Proofs

Description: 
Here's a few of us lucky folks hanging out in Discrete Math learning about those proofs and stuff! It's hard to believe that this was only a year ago it seems like this was just yesterday. Brenden, Steph, Bailey and I all crushing it with Dr. Karabegoph.

Reflection:
During my second semester here at acu I experienced the pain of writing proofs in CS 332: Algorithms. I was horrible at it and only sort of understood the process by the time I was done. Through the grace of God or faulty advising on behalf of the Advising office I was enrolled in Discrete mathematics the following semester. In this class I learned so much about the structure of mathematics, more importantly I learned how to properly write a proof. One of our second assignments in class was to write a proof by induction. After drilling it myself over and over I started to realize that this was not as magical as I had assumed during my time in Algorithms. Writing proofs followed a very structured pattern, a pattern that I now understood! 




### Flip those Bits

Flip those bits and Add One! Learning how to count in Binary was one of the most eye opening learning experiences of my life. To understand in great detail how a computer processes information de-mystified a lot of my misconceptions. I found doing this type of work very satisfying especially when we built our own memory flip flops and adders using gates. This learning also helped me when I started working at Next Lab. Being able to decipher a modbus memory table or dump data packets in binary and read them has helped me in my work there. All of these digital foundations I owe to Dr. Darby Hewett in ENGR 210 Digital logic.
