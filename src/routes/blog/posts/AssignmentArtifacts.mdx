## Text Adventure: A stranger Among us
<img src={strangers2} style="width: 500px"/>
### Description:

This is the cover art for our text adventure game, a stranger among us. We actually had a chat GPT generate that cover image along with some of the text. It's kind of impressive to watch the AI kind of generate these different types of scenarios that coupled among us and a realistic horror game really cool stuff. The text adventure game itself had nothing to do with AI.

### Reflection: 
Although this assignment was not the most complex piece of software I’ve written it’s for sure one of my favorites. Reeves had us build a text adventure game for Software engineering one, at the time I thought it was a simple enough task but there was a catch I was not alone, I had two others on the team. Brendan, Alex, and myself had a blast building this little adventure. Some rooms, items, and a little text narrative, all the ingredients for a great adventure! Importantly we learned what it meant to ship software, how to define unknowns and user stories. All skills I’ve experienced in industry already, but it was cool to watch my teammates come to grips with shipping “real code”.   

## Disk Wars:

### Description:

Disk wars was a project that I built for my web app class that used the web socket protocol to synchronize a disk through an in game browser. It's loosely based off of the 2010 movie Tron Legacy, specifically the scene where Sam Flynn battles Rensselaer in the arena.

### Reflection

The Grid, a Digital Frontier. The year was 2010. The world was simpler and I was much younger. This was the year I bought my first computer and this is the year as a wide eyed 13 year old I saw Tron Legacy. Tron Legacy, the sequel to the 1982 movie Tron depicted a world inside a computer where the programs were people and code constructed “physical” things like light cycles. When the main character Sam Flynn enters the “Grid” he is forced into a gladiatorial combat game “Disk Wars”. For my Web Application Development class I implemented a version of “Disk Wars” in the browser. Using real time events using websockets multiple players at a time can battle one another by throwing disks. Give it a try with a friend with the link below. 

## Discrete Math Proofs

### Description: 

The lucky few in discrete math: Steph, Brendan, Gri and I were so excited that day mainly because Bailey wasn't in class!   Kidding of course, we missed her so we sent her this picture of us. That was just an average day crushing it. We were there for all the proofs! 

### Reflection:

During my second semester here at acu I experienced the pain of writing proofs in CS 332: Algorithms. I was horrible at it and only sort of understood the process by the time I was done. Through the grace of God or faulty advising on behalf of the Advising office I was enrolled in Discrete mathematics the following semester. In this class I learned so much about the structure of mathematics, more importantly I learned how to properly write a proof. One of our second assignments in class was to write a proof by induction. After drilling it myself over and over I started to realize that this was not as magical as I had assumed during my time in Algorithms. Writing proofs followed a very structured pattern, a pattern that I now understood! 




## Flip those Bits

### Description: 
Here’s Dr. Darby himself showing us how to do state machines. I remember this day very well because he was very excited to show us how to do this sort of state graph correctly. Again one of the most interesting classes I have taken.
### Reflection:
Flip those bits and Add One! Learning how to count in Binary was one of the most eye opening learning experiences of my life. To understand in great detail how a computer processes information de-mystified a lot of my misconceptions. I found doing this type of work very satisfying especially when we built our own memory flip flops and adders using gates. This learning also helped me when I started working at Next Lab. Being able to decipher a modbus memory table or dump data packets in binary and read them has helped me in my work there. All of these digital foundations I owe to Dr. Darby Hewett in ENGR 210 Digital logic.
