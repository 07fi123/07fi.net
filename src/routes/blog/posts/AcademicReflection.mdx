I’m a non-traditional student. My Academic Journey here at ACU reflects that my time here has been short. I showed up in 2023 and will leave in 2025 with a degree in computer science. By the grace of God I’m actually going to Graduate! The reason I say that is because school is not something I’m naturally good at. I’m not super brilliant, I work hard but tend to internalize failure when I don’t do well. When everything you do is on a fixed scale it’s easy to claim to yourself that you are less of a person because you didn’t get X on Y assignment. 
	
My problems with Academics and eventual recovery is a ten year long story with many twists and turns. From Depression and sicide to working for the worlds top brands, I’ve been blessed with second, third and n number of chances to have a comeback story. My Academic start at ACU in the spring of 2023 was exceptional. I nailed my first semester with a 4.0 GPA, something I've never ever done! I proved to myself that I was capable if I lived with no fear. However, I wasn’t done learning, Fall 2023 kicked me in the teeth. 
	
Fall 2023 was a hard, not so good, time for my Academic performance. This was the semester where my illusions of perfecton were broken and I was forced to no longer put my faith in my own abilities, but to trust the Lord for my daily bread. Just ask Bailey Kimmel it was a hard one. Academically I made it out ok, and survived a difficult semester. Fall of 2023 wasn’t the end however. Spring of 2024 had its own challenges and nuances,but it didn't seem as bad. I really  was not prepared for Fall of 2024, my last fall semester. 
	
I don't know what it is about fall semesters at ACU but they're always hard. Perhaps looking back I would have seen the difficulty coming, however I didn’t anticipate how much responsibility I was taking on outside of the classroom. From leading the SIGCHI student research group, to playing with startups, and working at Next Lab I was spread super thin. I also didn’t anticipate how time consuming some of my classes were. Mobile app dev, Software Engineering and Statistical methods kicked me around pretty good and I felt it. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that stressed. I had to call in all the favors when it came to my health, but thankfully I had a great support system and I made it, again! I earned my first C at ACU but who cares, no perfection required! 

Right now, I stand to graduate this May with a degree. I didn’t think I’d be able to say that, Ever. If you would have asked Austin in 2016 if he ever would have wanted to go back to school or even though it was possible to earn a degree he would have laughed. I’m no longer that person anymore, I’m no longer the person who came to ACU on a wing and a prayer in 2023.  I’m so blessed to have done so well, and I’ve come so far. I’m about to be a College Graduate. Wow.
